# Earn mejor borrar?

Prime Finance has different types of fees that act as a earning method for users:

* Borrowing Fees: These fees are variable depending on the crypto asset and are distributed between the Users, Company, PRNT NFTs, and XDC NFTs.
* ~~Liquidation Fees: A 15% fee applies to a liquidation event; the reward is split between the liquidator and the protocol.~~

Earnings are dynamic, influenced by market conditions, and primarily derived from 3 sources:

### Borrowing Fees

Suppliers earn a share of the interests paid by borrowers. ~~This is calculated as the average borrow rate multiplied by the utilization rate of a reserve~~. Higher reserve utilization results in greater yields ~~for suppliers.~~

* Lenders

The total amount obtained by the protocol will vary depending on demand; 30% of this amount will be distributed as shared fees to users who deposit assets into the protocol.

* dLP users

70% of shared platform fees will be allocated to dLP users.

### PRNT emissions

Prime Numbers Labs defined and adjusted a specific amount for the distribution of incentives among users who validly qualify within the dLP mechanism.

The amount distributed monthly is different but remains fixed each month. As the months progress, this fixed amount varies based on price expectations and the number of dLP users.

To learn more about the mechanism or qualification requirements, visit the dLP section.

### Loan Liquidations

~~Each asset has its distinct supply-demand dynamics, reflected in its individual APY (Annual Percentage Yield), which changes over time. To gauge the rate's evolution, you can check the average annual rate over the last 30 days. Detailed data on each asset's reserve overview is available in the home section of the app.~~
