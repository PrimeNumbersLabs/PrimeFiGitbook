# Innovations in Lending and Borrowing

**Innovations in Lending and Borrowing**:

* PrimeFi is committed to cutting-edge technology. In this way, and through innovation to solve the existing problem of intercommunication between networks, we have adopted LayerZero technology:

1. This technology allows you to deposit an asset on one network and borrow another asset on a different network without any risk. All from within our protocol.
2. PRFI, as an OFT token, enables seamless bridging across all integrated networks on PrimeFi through our interface, without any bridge risk, thanks to Stargate-LayerZero technology.

* PrimeFi stands out for integrating NFTs into the lending and borrowing framework. This unique feature and an NFT marketplace allow for novel lending and borrowing opportunities involving NFTs.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The integration of NFTs will take place after the main features of the protocol are launched on Mainnet.
