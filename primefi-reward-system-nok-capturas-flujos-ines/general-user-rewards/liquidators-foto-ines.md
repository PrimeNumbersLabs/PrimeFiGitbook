In the same way mentioned previously, any user can obtain the role of liquidator and receive the benefit of liquidating a position that meets the liquidation requirements.

## Rewards for liquidators

Liquidators can be individual users, automated bots, or smart contracts participating in the liquidation process to gain profits by acquiring assets at favorable prices.&#x20;

Liquidation is a crucial component of lending and borrowing protocols as it contributes to the stability and security of the ecosystem by ensuring that obligations are met, and risks are effectively managed.

PrimeFi rewards liquidators with a fixed 7,5% liquidation bonus for the collateral asset liquidated.

### Examples

Bob lends 10 ETH and borrows 5 ETH worth of USDT. Should Bob's Health Factor fall below 1, his loan becomes eligible for liquidation. A liquidator has the option to repay up to 50% of the borrowed amount, equaling 2.5 ETH worth of USDT. In exchange, the liquidator can acquire a single collateral, which is in ETH and comes with a 7,5% bonus. The liquidator claims 2.5 + 0.1875 ETH as a reward for repaying 2.5 ETH worth of USDT.
