## Rewards for lenders

pTokens holders enjoy continuous earnings that dynamically adjust to market conditions, driven by:

1. Interest rate payments on loans: Suppliers participate in the interests paid by borrowers, proportional to the average borrow rate multiplied by the utilization rate. The higher the utilization of a reserve, the greater the yield for suppliers.&#x20;

Each asset operates within its unique market of supply and demand, featuring its own Annual Percentage Yield (APY) that evolves over time.&#x20;

To assess rate evolution, check the average annual rate over the past 30 days. Additionally, find comprehensive data on the reserve overview of each asset in the home section of the app.
