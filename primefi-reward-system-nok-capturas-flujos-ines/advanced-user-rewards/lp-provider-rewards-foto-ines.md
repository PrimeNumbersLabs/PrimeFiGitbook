No need to undergo any lock-up period



## Concentrated liquidity rewards

There is a possibility to go one step further, not only to earn fees generated from all active loans as a lender.

This situation arises when a lender locks at least 5% of their lend position in a liquidity pool, thus generating a concentrated liquidity token or pLP.

This token must undergo a locked staking process with various possible time frames. Locking the pLP generates rewards for the user in the form of PRFI emissions.

There are two ways to form the pLP position:

1. Borrow against lend deposit
2. Extra capital

Lock-up periods range from 30 to 360 days.

~~The emissions in the form of PRFI are for those who meet the conditions~~
