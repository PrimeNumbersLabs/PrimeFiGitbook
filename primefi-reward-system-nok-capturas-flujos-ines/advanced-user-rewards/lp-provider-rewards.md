<mark style="color:green;">The 12,75% of the total borrowing fees will be distributed along all liquidity providers depending on their LP positions.</mark>

## Concentrated liquidity rewards

There is a possibility to go one step further, not only to earn fees generated from all active loans as a lender.

This situation arises when a lender locks at least 5% of their lend position in a liquidity pool, thus generating a concentrated liquidity token or pLP.

This token must undergo a locked staking process with various possible time frames. Locking the pLP generates rewards for the user in the form of PRFI emissions.

There are two ways to form the pLP position:

1. Borrow against lend deposit
2. Extra capital

Lock-up periods range from 30 to 360 days.

~~The emissions in the form of PRFI are for those who meet the conditions~~

## Rewards for liquidators

Liquidators can be individual users, automated bots, or smart contracts participating in the liquidation process to gain profits by acquiring assets at favorable prices.&#x20;

Liquidation is a crucial component of lending and borrowing protocols as it contributes to the stability and security of the ecosystem by ensuring that obligations are met, and risks are effectively managed.

PrimeFi rewards liquidators with a fixed 7,5% liquidation bonus for the collateral asset liquidated.

### Examples

**Example 1**&#x20;

Boris lends 10 ETH and borrows 5 ETH worth of USDT. Should Boris's Health Factor fall below 1, his loan becomes eligible for liquidation. A liquidator has the option to repay up to 50% of the borrowed amount, equaling 2.5 ETH worth of USDT. In exchange, the liquidator can acquire a single collateral, which is in ETH and comes with a 7,5% bonus. The liquidator claims 2.5 + 0.1875 ETH as a reward for repaying 2.5 ETH worth of USDT.
