# pTokens

pTokens are interest-bearing tokens displayed as 'pXXXX' in your wallet (example: pUSDT for USDT).&#x20;

These tokens are created and eliminated when you deposit and withdraw funds.&#x20;

The value of pTokens is directly linked to the value of the respective deposited asset, maintaining a 1:1 ratio. All accrued interest is allocated to pTokens holders by progressively increasing the balance in their wallets.&#x20;

To exchange your pTokens back into the original asset, go to your deposits section on the Dashboard and follow the instructions for withdrawal.
