**Supplying Assets on the Platform:**

To supply assets, navigate to the "Supply" section and select "Supply" for the desired asset. Choose the amount you wish to supply and confirm the transaction\*. Your supply will be registered upon successful transaction confirmation, and you'll start accruing interest.

**Supply Limits:**

There is no minimum supply amount required. However, for very low amounts, the transaction costs may exceed potential earnings. It's advisable to consider this factor when supplying small amounts.

**Borrowing Options:**

Thanks to LayerZero, you will have different options when borrowing. You can withdraw an asset different from the one deposited on various networks according to your needs. Switching rates will apply to your entire debt for that asset. However, you can opt for different borrowing rates for different assets.

**Withdrawing Funds:**

To withdraw, visit the "Dashboard" and click on “Withdraw.” Choose your withdrawal amount and proceed with the transaction. Alternatively, you can leverage your “pTokens" for liquidity purposes without actually withdrawing. Ensure sufficient liquidity (unborrowed funds) is available for withdrawal. If not, you may need to wait for additional suppliers' liquidity or borrowers' repayment.
