# Testnet Faucets

Welcome to the guide on how to get Faucet for each of the available networks in the PrimeFi Testnet.

The currently available networks are Base Sepolia, Arbitrum Sepolia, and BNB Chain Testnet.

### 1.-Base Sepolia

The best way to get ETH Faucet on the Base network is as follows:

* &#x20;_**Bware Labs**_

{% hint style="success" %}
_You will be able to claim 0.025 ETH every 24h_
{% endhint %}

You just need to enter your Metamask wallet address and click the **Claim** button.

The Base network is the main one for the incentive campaign on Galxe. To complete each task, you will need to use the Base network.

### 2.-Arbitrum Sepolia

{% hint style="success" %}
_You will be able to claim 0.025 ETH every 24h_
{% endhint %}

On Arbitrum, we will get Faucet in the same way as we did with Base, through Bware Labs at the following link:

### 3.-BNB Chain Testnet

On the BNB testnet, we won’t use the same link as we did for the previous two networks. Instead, we’ll have two different ways to get BNB for the fees on its testnet:

#### A) **Official BNB Testnet Faucet**

BNB Chain provides a Faucet to obtain BNB, which comes with a requirement to fulfill:

{% hint style="warning" %}
_**0.002 BNB** on BSC Mainnet is needed for test funding_
{% endhint %}

Once the requirement is met, you simply need to paste your Metamask address and click the button that says: **"Send 0.3 BNB"**.

{% hint style="success" %}
_You will be able to claim_ 0.3 BNB every 24h
{% endhint %}

{% endembed %}

B) Official BNB Chain Discord Faucet

You will need to join the Discord through the following link:

[https://discord.com/channels/789402563035660308/1099937267021250560](https://discord.com/channels/789402563035660308/1099937267021250560)

Once inside, look for the Faucet section, where you will find a simple guide to obtaining tBNB for free.
