### Locked pLP (PrimeFi Liquidity)&#x20;

Borrowers and lenders engaging with prime liquidity tokens (pLP) contribute utility to the platform, enabling them to capture additional value from community engagement through the native token $PRFI.&#x20;

Participants in the ecosystem who lock pLP (PrimeFi Liquidity) and meet the 5% threshold can also earn platform revenue from borrowing interest, which are claimable fees on the Manage PrimeFi page.&#x20;

### How to lock pLP&#x20;

Before locking pLP, generate liquidity tokens on Balancer or Pancakeswap. Alternatively, you can flik into pLP.&#x20;

To manually lock pLP, navigate to the Manage PrimeFi page. Choose the amount of pLP tokens to lock and the lock duration of one, three, six, or twelve months. Each duration corresponds to a multiplier, with a 12-month lock earning 25X platform revenue compared to one month.

### Additional Notes&#x20;

* Locked pLP is subject to a mandatory variable lock duration (1 month to 1 year), and early unlocking is not permitted.&#x20;
* If you do not choose a default lock duration, the lock period will default to 3 months.&#x20;
* Each lock period comes with a distinct multiplier, ranging from 1x to 25x, contingent on the selected lock duration.&#x20;
* Fees generated from locked pLP can be claimed at any time without incurring penalties.&#x20;
* You will continue to receive fees throughout the entire lock period.&#x20;
* Platform fees are distributed linearly over a 7-day period.&#x20;
* If you opt to leave your locked PRFI in the protocol after the expiration date, disqualification bounty hunters will remove you from the locking pool, and you will forfeit the corresponding 7 days of streamed platform fees to the remaining pLP lockers in the pool.&#x20;
* To avoid disqualification, activate the auto-relock function from the Manage PrimeFi page.
